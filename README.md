# Python Calculator

## Summary
This is a simple addition-only calculator originally created in Google Colab using Python.  No databases are required.

Despite its simplicity and few lines, this was my very first Python script that brought me a deep sense of reward when I finally figured out how to make it work.

## Languages and Libraries Used
The language used is Python.  No databases (or libraries) are needed.  Script can be ran accessing the Colab link included in the script file, or can be copy and pasted wherever Python is accepted.

## Key Learnings
As a beginner in Python (and in coding), two key learnings acquired during the process of scripting this calculator were internalizing the importance of 1) being clear of what I actually wanted to accomplish (what would my end goal should look like) and 2) understanding the actual scripting (what does the syntax really mean)?
