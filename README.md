# Python Calculator

## Summary

This repository contains a simple addition-only calculator, originally created in Google Colab using Python. It doesn’t rely on any databases or external libraries.

While the calculator is simple and consists of only a few lines of code, it marks my first successful Python script. Completing it gave me a profound sense of accomplishment as I figured out how to make it work.

## Languages and Libraries Used

- **Python**: The language used for this calculator.
- No external libraries or databases are required.

The script can be run directly by accessing the Colab link provided in the script file, or you can copy and paste it into any environment that supports Python.

## Key Learnings

As a beginner in Python and coding in general, working on this calculator taught me two key lessons:

1. The importance of clearly defining the end goal—understanding what I actually wanted to achieve before starting.
2. The value of deeply understanding the syntax—knowing exactly what each line of code does.
